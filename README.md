This project uses the DMXSerial library created by Matthias Hertel, a helpful library that makes DMX reception (and various other functions) on 16 MHz Atmega powered Arduinos very easy.

His page: http://www.mathertel.de/Arduino/DMXSerial.aspx

Here he describes many of its other features which I am not fully taking advantage of. 

The download for the library is on his Github: https://github.com/mathertel/DmxSerial
